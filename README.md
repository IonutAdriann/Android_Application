DRIONIMA - MY FITNESS APP

DRIONIMA - My Fitness App is an Android application developed to help people to keep track and to receive suggestions about their health and lifestyle.
The app allows a user to monitor their habits which affect their health conditions, such as the hours of sleep, the physical exercises performed and the amount of water.
During the profile installation, the user is able to insert its information regarding its current lifestyle, its physical conditions and its expectations for the future.

Everyday, the user will be encouraged to insert data and information about their form and their actions, so that the system can record them. The app then displays the information collected organizing them in graphs, and it compares them to the expected values inserted by the user.

Moreover, the app allows the user to create personal workout plans, where relevant details such as the number of repetitions and the duration of an exercise can be added.

The team is really looking forward to developing this application, since all of the members have very active lifestyles and they believe that this app could help not only them but also the other sport-passionate people like them.
